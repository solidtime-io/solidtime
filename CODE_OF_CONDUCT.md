# Code of Conduct

The goal is to create a community that is open and welcoming to all individuals.
To achieve this, we have developed a code of conduct that outlines the expectations for behavior of all members of our community.

## Pledge

This community is founded on respect and understanding.
All members are expected to treat others with respect and empathy, and to not tolerate any form of discrimination,
harassment, or attacks.

## Expectations

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate
and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits,
issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily
or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Contact
