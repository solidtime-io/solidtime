<!--
This project is early stage. The structure and APIs are still subject to change and not stable.
Therefore, we do not currently accept any contributions, unless you are a member of the team.

As soon as we feel comfortable enough that the application structure is stable enough, we will open up the project for contributions.

We do accept contributions in the [documentation repository](https://github.com/solidtime-io/docs) f.e. to add new self-hosting guides.
